Good Idea from the Ladies

Halaa/Sandra:
Users with Common Interests are encouraged to schedule interest related dates at local places

Halaa:
Less Shallow
More about common Interests

For the date suggestions maybe add a group option for the adventurous
  Also try to make it so everyone has a friend within the group

Sandra:
Friendship App
Dick Meter

Me:
Sadie Hawkins where only girls can initial contact
-Halaa wasn't the biggest fan thought guys should have equal rights
